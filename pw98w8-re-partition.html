Hello~ I'm not terribly great with computers, but last year I managed to set up boot camp on my macbook pro and have been using windows for autodesk and steam. I'm confused about my lack of space on the drive. As it was a while ago I don't remember exactly how much I partitioned, but it seems to be 50gb. I've been doing some research and it seems games take up more space than I realized, but I uninstalled the two that I had downloaded and I still am having trouble. I only have 10.6gb available.

I just got my T470 and couldn't be happier. The thing is, the SSD (1 TB) is like one partition and windows 10 is already installed on it.

I've heard horror stories of people wrecking hard drives beyond recovery with partition mishaps.

So I have gone through 2 SSD's now with my old mobo (P45 UD3L) and found after a lot of headscratching that the mobo doesn't support AHCI, only IDE, it really isn't a big deal to me running in IDE since I'm not a power user. However I have a left over a 128GB SSD, 74GB 10,000 RPM HDD and a standard 1TB HDD which all are not being recognized - even in BIOS.

I plan on having FO4 on there with mods. And FTL. I'm setting up the 500gb HDD right now and I noticed I can mount it to a file path in my SSD.

What is recovery partition? Can I delete recovery partition for further use? Find everything I was attempting to do a clean install of windows 7 on my Asus x401a.
